# 🗺️ Civic Issue Heatmap & Analysis System

## 📍 Overview
This project visualizes civic issues like **traffic congestion, waste accumulation, pollution**, and **issue density** using heatmaps.  
It helps identify problem zones in a city (tested on data from *Jadhav*) to support better decision-making and civic management.

## 🎯 Key Features
- 🌆 Interactive heatmap for traffic and pollution hotspots  
- 🗑️ Waste density analysis by region  
- 🚦 Traffic congestion visualization using live or historical data  
- 📊 Problem type breakdown and severity mapping  
- 📍 Location-based issue reporting insights  

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Folium / Plotly / Matplotlib**
- **Pandas / NumPy**
- **GeoJSON / OpenStreetMap Data**
